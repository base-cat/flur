## Environment Variables and Tracker API

The tracker API is a modified version of cat-token-box with additional endpoints for Flur. It provides enhanced capabilities for managing CAT Protocol assets on fractal bitcoin. For details, see [open-fractal/cat-token-box](https://github.com/open-fractal/cat-token-box).


1. Clone the cat-token-box repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-fractal/cat-token-box.git
   cd cat-token-box
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in the cat-token-box `README.md` to get the tracker API running.

3. Once the tracker API is operational, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your Flur project. Add the following environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or the URL where your tracker API is running
   ```

4. Adjust the URL to match where your tracker API is hosted if it's not running on localhost.
